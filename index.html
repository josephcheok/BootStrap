          I am a professional accountant by trade but an analytical problem
          solver at heart. That was the part of my work I really enjoyed. I had
          an opportunity while I was an accountant at a power grid construction
          company to standardise the reporting process for project engineers on
          Excel. I programmed some of the repetitive steps project enginners
          performed to prepare their monthly reports into push type button
          macros using Visual Basic, saving their time. Having very little
          background in programming, I bridged the knowledge gap to enable what
          I do through YouTube and online forums. Once I have created an
          automated reporting template for the engineers and my assignment was
          over, I was hungry for more!
          <br />
          <br />
          I also run a fully customisable apparel shop online called
          <a href="https://www.drawn2life.com.au"
            ><img id="business-logo" src="images/drawn2lifelogo.png"/></a
          >. What we do is we allow the customer to draw up their own t-shirt,
          bag, tote or leggings using our templates. We then get the customer to
          take a shot of the artwork on our template, I would then refine and
          digitise the artwork using Photoshop and Illustrator before
          transferring the art over to fabric, which is then cut up and sewn to
          the customer's size and taste. I also had an opportunity to dwelve
          into website construction with the help of the tools provided by
          Shopify. But there is a lot more things that I want to do on the
          website that go beyond their basic tools!
